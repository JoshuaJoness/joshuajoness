            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                As early as 5 years old, I remember laying in mother's bed, in the middle of the afternoon, staring at the ceiling. I would ponder upon questions such as,
                "if God created the universe, who created God?" and "what is the universe expanding into?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Questions like these fascinated my young mind. Little did I know that several years later, I would choose Philosophy as
                one of my majors in university.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have always been a deep thinker. I have always questioned authority, challenged the norm. This has not always led 
                to positive results, but it has brought me where I am today.
            </p>
            <p>
                So who <i>am</i> I?
            </p>
            <p>
                My name is Joshua Maurice Jones. I was born in Toronto, Canada. I grew up in a suburb called Scarborough. I had a good 
                family upbrining, but things were far from perfect. Like a lot of households, mine was filled with toxicity. Due to this,
                and the angst of being a teenage boy looking for belonging and meaning in the world, I got into a lot of trouble when I
                was younger.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had a lot of time to reflect, ponder, reason. It is my belief that we are all here to bring something to this world; to 
                manifest our highest purpose, our life's mission.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was not until several ups and downs, mistakes and failures, that I finally found something that I love. As of today,
                I am happy to say that I am employed as a software engineer in one of Canada's top tech scenes, Kitchener, Ontario.
            </p>
            <h2>Strength</h2>
            <p>
                Like a lot of young boys, I have always been fascinated by strength. Kung fu masters, martial arts, ancient yogic secrets, 
                bodybuilders and strongmen; all of these things resonated with me to the core.
            </p>
            <p>
                To me strength is about more than looking good or even feeling good. To me, the practice of strength, is a spiritual discipline;
                one that can improve every aspect of our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Strength builds discipline. Strength gives you goals. Strength forces you to work on your weak points. Strength brings 
                balance. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am avid weight lifter, practicioner of calisthentics, and yin yoga enthusiast. I try to incorpate both 'yin' and 'yang' 
                aspects into my training. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My training is my philosophy; my philosophy is my training.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is my hopes that by sharing my experiences, I can help you to become stronger in all aspects of your life. This is not a 
                rigid, stiff and hardened strength; but rather a fluid, bending, and flowing strength. For if strength is your only strength, 
                it becomes a weakness.
            </p>
