            I have a hunger for learning. I love computer science because there are so many interesting topics. Currently I'm working as a web developer but I also 
            have an interest in embedded programming, machine learning, robotics, and data science.

            Cloesly related to programming is my love for design. I love making things that look and <i>feel</i> awesome! I've always had a natural talent for art and 
            creativity. I love that I get to express some of that in my day to day work. I hope to hone this skill in the coming years, perhaps combining drawing with 
            the creation of 3D models.

            Besides computer-related stuff, I'm an avid workout enthusiast. I love powerlifting and bodybuilding *workout emoji*. I also practice Jiu Jitsu and yoga. 
            I also love taking long meditative walks. *yoga emoji* *walking emoji* #enlightenment

            I love travelling. I love Spain. I love Thailand.

            <br/>
            I'm well-travelled, well-educated, and well-read. I don't say this boast, but to speak to the fact that these things help give me a unique perspective 
            on the world. My degree in business and philosophy allows me to keep the business objectives of projects in mind. I'm able to speak the languages of both
            developers and business parties.
